Description: UPnP Media Renderer front-end to MPD, the Music Player Daemon
 upmpdcli acts as an UPnP Media Renderer on the front-end so that you can
 control it with any UPnP controller like, e.g. Audionet or BubbleUPnP on an
 Android tablet. It uses an MPD instance to actually play the tracks. 
 A typical configuration might have for example, MPD running on a Raspberry
 PI, with upmpdcli on the same host or any other Linux PC on the network.
